#### Mac Installation 

The other tutorial for this project (https://github.com/icsi-berkeley/ecg-specializer/blob/master/specializer_tutorial.md) explains how to run the grammar on Command Line, along with the Specializer. It also includes a section for running the Morse simulation, but this is only possible if you’ve installed Morse. Morse is a simulator that uses the Blender graphics engine; it’s been formally tested in Linux, but we run it successfully on Macs - as far as I know, it hasn’t been tested on Windows.

The Morse website conveniently includes instructions (http://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/1.2/user/installation.html) for installation
